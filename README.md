## My process

### What I learned

1. JavaScript Fundamentals: I deepened my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and asynchronous operations like fetching data from JSON files.

2. Data Management: I explored different techniques for managing data within a web application, including storage options like cookies, local storage, and session storage. I gained insights into when each storage method is appropriate based on data persistence requirements.

3. Modular Development: I practiced modular development by organizing code into separate files and using ES6 module syntax for better structure and maintainability. This approach helped in separating concerns and improving code readability.

4. User Interaction: I enhanced my skills in handling user interactions such as toggling cart visibility, adding products to a cart, adjusting quantities, and updating the UI dynamically based on user actions.

5. Debugging and Error Handling: I gained experience in debugging JavaScript code, identifying common errors like null references and handling them gracefully to ensure the application functions correctly.

6. Best Practices: I adhered to best practices such as using descriptive function and variable names, optimizing code for performance, and ensuring clean, readable, and maintainable code throughout the project.

7. Implemented server-side Stripe integration using Express.js to handle creating Checkout Sessions for online payments.

8. Utilized Stripe's API to dynamically generate Checkout Sessions based on user-selected items.
