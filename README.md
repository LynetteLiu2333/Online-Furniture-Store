## My process

### What I learned

**Front-End Development:**

- Dynamic Content Management: Utilized JavaScript to dynamically manage content and user interactions on the front-end. This included handling product listings and user cart interactions (e.g., app.js, cartUtils.js).

- Third-Party Integrations: Integrated third-party services such as Stripe for payment processing (e.g., stripeCheckout.js).

- Data Management: Used JSON to store and retrieve product data efficiently (e.g., product.json). This facilitated dynamic content loading and rendering on the front-end.

**Back-End Development:**

- Server Setup: Learned to set up a server using Node.js and Express (e.g., server.js). This included configuring routes for handling HTTP requests and serving static files.

- Middleware Usage: Implemented middleware for handling various aspects of request processing, such as parsing JSON bodies and managing sessions.

- Dependencies: Managed project dependencies using package.json and package-lock.json. This included understanding the role of different packages and how they contribute to the project's functionality.

- Stripe Integration: Integrated Stripe for handling payment processing securely and efficiently. This involved setting up Stripe on both the client and server sides to manage transactions and ensure data security.

- Git: Utilized Git for version control, ensuring that changes to the codebase are tracked and managed properly (e.g., .gitignore).
